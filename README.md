✨ ~ I'm a college sophomore from Chicago passionate about UI/UX design! I'm in the middle of building my own website, and learning JavaScript and React to make it happen! ~ ✨

🥇 I built my first website via my dual enrollment class at IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology) which sparked my interest in front-end design, what led me to WIN my first hackathon with Code for Good at Google HQ!

⚡ It geared me towards not only making creative websites, but how to make websites more creative and accessible!

🛠️ Let me know if I can support with any projects! Though I prefer front-end and visual design, I have some back-end experience too in Data Structures (C++) and object-oriented programming (Java).
